This folder will include `docker compose` files for people who want to spin up
cashu-feni alongside with `lnbits` with a fake wallet backend.

This setup should only be used for local development - testing lightning
capabilities of cashu-feni

Furthermore, we will include a `docker compose` step to set up the python implementation of
[cashu](https://github.com/callebtc/cashu) for local comparison and integration testing
of both implementations
